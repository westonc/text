who knows how those tiny winds blow
who knows, who knows
and how they move an inner windrose 
who knows, who knows

something of how they stop and start
their heights and lows and turn of heart
and when they turn to working art
who knows

who knows how whispers turn to words
who knows, who knows
and how those find their way to 
who knows, who knows

where inside they turn to
bird, blurred, burd, burred, byrd, curd, ferd, furred, gerd, gird,
gjerde, heard, herd, hird, hurd, jerde, kurd, leard, nerd, purred, 
slurred, spurred, stirred, third, whirred 
sure, were

who knows where they grow to song
who knows, who knows
string of heart and breath of long strong
who knows, who knows

make their way to music high
